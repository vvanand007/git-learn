Step to push a repo on GIT
1. Crate a remote repository on the GitHub.
2. Create a local repository with the same name if possible. You can crate with different name as well.
3. Open command prompt in the local repository and hit "git init". This will initialize the local repo to be pushed to remote.
4. Hit "git remote add origin git@github.com:vvanand007/new-project.git". Here new-project is your remote repo name.
5. Now "git add ." -> git commit -m "commit message" -> "git push --set-upstream origin master"
