Step to push a repo on GIT
1. Crate a remote repository on the GitHub.
2. Create a local repository with the same name if possible. You can crate with different name as well.
3. Open command prompt in the local repository and hit "git init". This will initialize the local repo to be pushed to remote.
4. If by default the initial branch name is 'master', change the branch name to 'main' using "git branch -m master main".
5. Hit "git remote add origin git@github.com:vvanand007/new-project.git". Here new-project is your remote repo name.
6. If you are getting error while pushing the inital commit, it is because the local and remote repo is already having a commit where as the local repo doesn't have any commit. When you try to push it warns that remote has history that the local branch doesn't have and it doesn't let you overwrite it. Take a pull using "git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories" and resolve if you get any conflicts.
7. Now "git add ." -> git commit -m "commit message" -> "git push --set-upstream origin master"
